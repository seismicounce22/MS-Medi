Pharmacy Inventory Management System (C++ | DSA Project)
 Overview

The Pharmacy Inventory Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ that simulates real-world medical store operations.

This project was built to apply core Data Structures & Algorithms concepts in a practical system rather than just solving isolated problems.

It allows efficient management of medicines, sales tracking, and issue handling.

Features

Add new medicines to inventory

Search medicines by name

Display complete inventory

Sell medicines and update stock

Update medicine details

Delete medicines

View recent sales records

Manage issue queue

🧠 Data Structures & Concepts Used

Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)

Queue (for issue handling)

Dynamic Data Handling

Searching Algorithms

File Handling (for persistent storage, if used)

Structured Data Organization

🛠 Technologies Used

C++

Standard Template Library (if used)

File I/O

 Purpose of Project

This project demonstrates how DSA concepts power real-world systems like inventory management.

It strengthened my understanding of:

Data organization

Logical structuring of systems

Handling dynamic records

Real-world implementation of queues and search operations
